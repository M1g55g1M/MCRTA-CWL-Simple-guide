Setting RedCloud OS:

1. Follow the instructions provided by CWL;
2. This is NOT a "light" OS, if possible set it to 8 GB of RAM and 8 processors for a smoother experience:

3. For some out worldly reason, the OS when first executed in VMware doesn't come with a set Network Adapter, so don't freak out like I did and add it by going in the settings and enjoy internet access (set it to NAT for simplicity):

   Now you should be good to go and start hacking!

   Overall tips:
   1. Follow the material provided (PDF + Videos);
   2. Usually the last few videos - or the last - are the actual hacking but in a diferent setting (the instructor may start with diferent credentials and you will need to adapt the commands provided; nothing fancy or out of the scope, it's just not like TryHackMe where you copy and paste the exact same command line);
   3. The Hints are usefull, be aware that those commands need to get more arguments or parameters in order to work properly.
